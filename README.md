Odin Project Foundations Landing Page

During this project I used HTML and CSS to replicate a provided landing page. Some roadblocks that I faced during this was struggling to simultaneously juggle the HTML skeleton with the styling of CSS. Learning how to properly utilize flexbox and box model were essential to completing the project. Going forward, it would be beneficial to employ more usage of flexbox in places where I may have scraped by the proper alignment with basic padding/margin - especially in order to create responsive web designs with media queries in the future.
